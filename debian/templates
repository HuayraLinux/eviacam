Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Should eviacamloader be installed "setuid root"?
 Installing eviacamloader with the set-user-ID bit set enables all
 users who have been added to the group "eviacam" to launch eviacam
 with a modified scheduling priority for better responsiveness.
 .
 Since this setting allows eviacamloader to be run with superuser
 privileges, it may have security implications in the case of
 vulnerabilities in eviacamloader's code.
